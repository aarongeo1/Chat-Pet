# Chat-Pet ( IN PROGRESS .... )

## A virtual desktop pet with a chatbot

Created using Python and its libraries which are 
* Tensorflow
* Tkinter
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* pandas

## What is it?

Its a pet that keeps you company as you carry on with your day to day tasks and also can have a conversation with you on a basic level whenever the user feels bored.

## Chatbot
* The chatbot uses NLP to analyze and understand the natural human language in context.
* A chat gui made using python tkinter is used to converse with the chatbot
* The chatbot model has been intially trained with a really small dataset due to hardware capacity and lack of good dataset for conversations.

# Upcoming Releases
* The model can now converse but it will be able to answer mental health related questions as a basic form of a therapist in the upcoming dataset which is now in creation.
<sup> The basic training model code and datasets also more assets will be uploaded soon as some minor changes need to be fixed before proper implementation </sup>
